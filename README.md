# AnimeList Web Scraping Project

Welcome to my first web scraping project, which marks the initial phase of an exciting app I'm planning to build! This project aims to scrape data from various anime websites and store users' favorite anime in a list format.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: This project is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, for server-side scripting.
- **npm Packages**: npm is used as the package manager for this project. Notable packages include:
  - **Puppeteer**: Used for web scraping. Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.
  - **dotenv**: Used for securely storing credentials and environment variables.
  - **pg**: PostgreSQL client for Node.js. It enables interaction with PostgreSQL databases from within Node.js applications.
  - **pgAdmin4**: A PostgreSQL administration and management tool used for database management.
